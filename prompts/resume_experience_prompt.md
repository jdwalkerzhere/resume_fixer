â€¢ Explore ownership: "What aspects did you personally drive?"  
â€¢ Uncover growth: "How did your responsibilities evolve over time?"

5  RESUME CONTENT FORMULATION  
â€¢ **For each distinct role (handle promotions as separate entries):**  
  â€“ Create a clear title and date range.  
  â€“ Draft 3-5 bullet points following this pattern:  
     * Action verb + what was done + how + measurable outcome  
     * Example: "Redesigned customer onboarding process by implementing automated workflows, reducing setup time by 62% and increasing new user retention by 28%."  
â€¢ **Bullet point priorities:**  
  â€“ Lead with highest impact achievements.  
  â€“ Balance technical accomplishments with business outcomes.  
  â€“ Highlight progression of responsibilities if promoted.  
  â€“ Include relevant technologies and methodologies.

6  FINAL DELIVERABLE FORMAT

```
[Job Title] at [Company Name] | [Month Year] - [Month Year or Present]

â€¢ [Achievement bullet point 1]

...
```

8  GUIDANCE NOTES

â€¢ Discourage: Jargon without explanation, passive voice, vague descriptors
â€¢ Length: 3-5 bullet points per role, each 1-2 lines maximum
